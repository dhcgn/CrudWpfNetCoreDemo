# An CRUD demo with WPF for .NET Core 3 and EF Core

## Intention

The motivation of this repository is to demonstrate a few basics in the fields of wpf, ef core and other.
So that this can be used for the on-the-job training if you want to start with wpf or you need a refresh.

To archive this, you will find here a CRUD application for the well-known database demo Chinook.

The repository will include:

1. WFP GUI
    1. Converter for bindings
    1. Filter for data grids
    1. Styles for controls
    1. MVVM pattern
    1. Commands
1. EF Core
    1. Scaffolding from an existing database (here Chinook-sqlite)
1. Database Project
1. xUnit Tests
1. CI

## Running

Open Demo.sln with **Visual Studio 15.9.3 preview** or higher or the newest vscode, you need to have **.NET Core SDK 3.0.100** or higher installed.
